In this video, i will show you how to debug temporal workflow.

Let's open a k9s, a kubernetes command line interface. We can search kubernetes
resource by this tool.

I will connect to kubernetes man03 cluster. So i need to modify environment variable
KUBECONFIG as ~/.kube/int.yaml. It was download from wiki page.

I will use idp-service as a example. The idp-service is under tps namespace. Let's

go to tps namespace. The temporal configuration is a config map. Let's open it.

From the configuration file, the default grpc server is no longer localhost, but 
a remote url.

The webserver is temporal ui. Let's take a look at temporal UI.

It you need to login, click 'continue with microsoft'.

This temporal ui is good for debug. I can observe the execution history of workflow.

Make sure namespace is correct. Then we can search our workflow by task queue name


The payload of workflow is here.
And i can see users to synchronize. From SyncUserWorkflow payload. 

Let's take a look at activity. The input of FetchUserDataActivity is a tenant with some user id.

And the output shows this user has many planner codes.

Now let's check the UpdateUserDataActivity. The input should be user id ,tenant, and planner codes.

And the output is null.
