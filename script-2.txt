now let's focus on consumer side.


Let's check our created workflow.

The namespace of this workflow is default. 
And the workflow type is SyncUserWorkflow. 
The queue name is com.sap.sbnc.plan.temporal.SyncUserWorkflow.

For the consumer side, we need to make sure that 
we connected to the same temporal server, same name space, same task queue name, 
listen to same workflow type, compared with producer

This is java code to register worker. 

because our spring profile is not cloud, 
temporal auto configuration will connect to local server, same with producer.

The workflow client created by auto configuration connect to the 'default' namespace, 
by local_config.yaml, also same with producer.


Before start our server, there are no available workers.
So our consumer should connect to the default namespace.
