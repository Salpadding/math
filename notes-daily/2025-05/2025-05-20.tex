\subsubsection{Linear Mapping}

\begin{exercise}
let $V, U$ both be linear space on field $F$, and $\phi: V \to U$ is a linear mapping, define

\[
    \mathrm{Im}(\phi) = \phi(V)
\]

and

\[
    \mathrm{Ker}(\phi) = \{x \in V: \phi(x) = 0\}
\]

prove: $\mathrm{Im}(\phi)$ and $\mathrm{Ker}(\phi)$ is linear space
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    obviously
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
    prove: $\phi$ is surjective iff $\dim \mathrm{Im}(\phi) = \dim U$, and $\phi$ is injective iff $\mathrm{Ker}(\phi) = 0$
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    pick a basis $e_1, e_2, .., e_n$ of $V$, we got

    \[
        \mathrm{Im}(\phi) = \mathrm{span}(\phi(e_1), \phi(e_2), .., \phi(e_n))
    \]

    if $\mathrm{Im}(\phi) = U$, we must have $\dim \mathrm{Im}(\phi) = \dim U$
    
    on the other hand, we pick a basis of $\mathrm{Im}(\phi)= \{ f_1,f_2,..,f_n \}$ and $U$
    has a basis $g_1,g_2,..,g_n$,  and there are some linear combination so that:

    \[
        [g_1,g_2,..,g_n]A =  [f_1,f_2,..,f_n]
    \]

    and $A$ must be invertible

    if $\phi$ is injective, let's define $\phi(x) = 0$, since $\phi(0) = 0$, then we got $x=0$
    
    on ther other hand, if $\mathrm{Ker}(\phi) = 0$, let $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$ then we got $x-y \in \mathrm{Ker}(\phi)$
    thus we got $x=y$
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
    let $V, U$ is linear space on field $F$ and $\dim V = n,\: \dim U = m$, $\phi: V \to U$
    is a linear mapping, and $T(\phi) = A$

    prove: $\mathrm{rank}(\phi) = \mathrm{rank}(A)$ and $\dim \mathrm{Ker}(\phi) = n - \mathrm{rank}(A)$
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    let $V$ has a basis $\{ e_1, e_2, .., e_n \}$ and $U$ has a basis $\{ f_1,f_2,..,f_m\}$ 
    and $\eta_1: V \to F^n,\: \eta_2: U \to F^m$, we will show that $\mathrm{Ker}(\phi)$ is isomorphism with $\mathrm{Ker}(A)$ by $\eta_1$

    we first prove $\eta_1$ is well define, which means $\eta_1(x) \in \mathrm{Ker}(A)$,

    then we prove $\eta_1$ is surjective, which means $\forall x \in \mathrm{Ker}(A), \eta_1^{-1}(x) \in \mathrm{Ker}(\phi)$

    since isomorphism linear space has same dimension. we have

    \[
        \dim \mathrm{Ker}(\phi) = \dim \mathrm{Ker}(A) = n - \mathrm{rank}(A)
    \]

    also we will prove $\mathrm{Im}(\phi)$ is isomorphism with $\mathrm{Im}(A)$ by mapping $\eta_2$

    we first prove $\eta_2$ is well define, which means $\eta_2(x) \in \mathrm{Im}(A)$,


    then we prove $\eta_2$ is surjective, which means $\forall x \in \mathrm{Im}(A), \eta_2^{-1}(x) \in \mathrm{Im}(\phi)$

    since isomorphism linear space has same dimension. we have

    \[
        \dim \mathrm{Im}(\phi) = \dim \mathrm{Im}(A) = \mathrm{rank}(A)
    \]
\end{proof}
